# Intro to Coding  
## Session 1 — Your First Interactive Story

Welcome to **Session 1** of *Intro to Coding*!

In this session, students build the **first playable version** of a *Choose Your Own Adventure* game. By the end of today’s class, students will have a web page where clicking buttons changes the story — and they’ll understand how their code makes that happen.

No prior coding experience is needed.

## 🎯 What Students Will Do in Session 1

In this session, students will:
- Create a simple webpage using **HTML**
- Add basic styling with **CSS**
- Use **JavaScript** to respond to button clicks
- Change story text based on player choices
- Run their project in a web browser

Most importantly, students will leave with something they can **run, click, and show**.

## 📁 Files in This Folder

This session uses **three files**:

index.html   → The story page
style.css    → How the page looks
script.js    → What happens when buttons are clicked

Each file has a different role, and students will learn how they work together.

## ▶️ How to Run the Project

### Option 1: Using VS Code (Recommended)
1. Open this `session-1` folder in **Visual Studio Code**
2. Right-click `index.html`
3. Choose **“Open with Live Server”**

### Option 2: Using a Web Browser
- Double-click `index.html` to open it in a browser  
(Chrome, Edge, Firefox, or Safari all work)

Once it’s open:
- Click the buttons
- Watch the story change
- You’ve built an interactive program!

## ✍️ What Students Can Customize

Students are encouraged to:
- Change the story text
- Rename the buttons
- Write their own opening scene
- Make the story funny, spooky, dramatic, or silly

There are no “wrong” stories — creativity is part of the learning.

## 🧠 Big Ideas from Session 1

This session introduces:
- **HTML** → structure (what’s on the page)
- **CSS** → style (how it looks)
- **JavaScript** → behavior (what happens when you click)

Students learn that code can control a story, not just numbers.

## 🆘 Getting Help

It’s normal to get stuck while learning to code — even professionals do!

If something doesn’t work:
- Check spelling and punctuation
- Make sure file names match exactly
- Ask for help during class

For extra learning, we recommend trusted, beginner-friendly resources like:
- MDN Web Docs (Mozilla)
- freeCodeCamp
- W3Schools

**Important Note for Students:**  
**Always follow your family’s rules and expectations when using the internet.** If you’re unsure whether a website is okay to use, please check with a parent or guardian first.

## 🚀 What’s Next?

In **Session 2**, students will:
- Build a story engine
- Add multiple story pages
- Create branching paths without copying lots of code

For now, if the buttons work and the story changes — **you did it!** 🎉

If you’d like next, I can also:
	•	Write Session 2–5 READMEs in the same style
	•	Add a short parent-only note section
	•	Create a printable PDF version
	•	Include screenshots or diagrams for younger students

Just tell me how far you want to take it.
