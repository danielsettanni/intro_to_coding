## Session 1 — Build Your First Interactive Story

In this guide, you’ll build your **first interactive game** using:

- **HTML** (structure)
- **CSS** (style)
- **JavaScript** (interaction)

You will make changes **one step at a time**, and after each step you’ll run the page and *see something new happen*.

---

## 🧰 Step 0 — Create Your Project Folder

**What this does for you:**  
Keeps your project organized so your HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files can work together.

1. Create a folder named:

   `session-1`

2. Open this folder in **VS Code**

All files you create will live inside this folder.

---

## 🌐 Step 1 — Create `index.html` (The Story Page)

**What this does for you:**  
Creates the *basic webpage* your game will live on, so you can see text in a browser.

### What you should see

A page with a title and a paragraph of story text.

### Instructions

1. Create a file named:

   `index.html`

2. Paste in this code:

   ```html
   <!DOCTYPE html>
   <html>
   <head>
    <title>Choose Your Own Adventure</title>
   </head>

   <body>
    <h1>Choose Your Own Adventure</h1>

    <p>
      You are standing at a fork in the road.
    </p>
   </body>
   </html>
   ```

3. Save the file

**Run it**

- Double-click `index.html`, or
- Right-click → Open with Live Server

✅ You should see:  
A page with a heading and one sentence of story text.

---

## 🎨 Step 2 — Add Structure for the Game Area

**What this does for you:**  
Puts your story inside a “game box” so it’s easier to style and easier for JavaScript to control later.

### What you should see

The page looks the same, but your story is now inside a “container.”

### Instructions

Replace the `<body>` section with this:

```html
<body>
  <div id="game">
    <h1>Choose Your Own Adventure</h1>

    <p id="storyText">
      You are standing at a fork in the road.
    </p>
  </div>
</body>
```

Save and refresh.

✅ You should see:  
The same content — now grouped inside a div.

(This will matter when we add styles and JavaScript.)

---

## 🎨 Step 3 — Create `style.css` (Make It Look Better)

**What this does for you:**  
Makes your game easier to read and more fun to look at by adding a background and a “card” for the story.

### What you should see

- A light background
- A white “card” holding your story

### Instructions

1. Create a file named:

   `style.css`

2. Paste this into `style.css`:

   ```css
   body {
     background-color: #f2f2f2;
     font-family: Arial, sans-serif;
     display: flex;
     justify-content: center;
     padding-top: 40px;
   }

   #game {
     background-color: white;
     padding: 20px;
     width: 400px;
     border-radius: 10px;
   }
   ```

3. Link the CSS file in `index.html` by adding this inside `<head>`:

   ```html
   <link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">
   ```

Save and refresh.

✅ You should see:  
Your story centered on the page inside a white box.

---

## 🔘 Step 4 — Add Buttons (Choices)

**What this does for you:**  
Adds the player’s choices to the game. Buttons are how the player interacts with your story.

### What you should see

Two buttons appear under the story.

### Instructions

Inside the `#game` div in `index.html`, add this below the paragraph:

```html
<div id="choices">
  <button id="choiceLeft">Go left</button>
  <button id="choiceRight">Go right</button>
</div>
```

Save and refresh.

✅ You should see:  
Two buttons labeled Go left and Go right.

(They don’t do anything yet — that’s next!)

---

## ⚙️ Step 5 — Create `script.js` (Make Buttons Work)

**What this does for you:**  
Turns your page into a real game by making the buttons do something. When the player clicks, the story changes.

### What you should see

Clicking a button changes the story text.

### Instructions

1. Create a file named:

   `script.js`

2. Paste this into `script.js`:

   ```javascript
   const storyText = document.getElementById("storyText");
   const leftButton = document.getElementById("choiceLeft");
   const rightButton = document.getElementById("choiceRight");

   leftButton.onclick = () => {
     storyText.textContent =
       "You walk down the left path and hear something moving in the trees.";
   };

   rightButton.onclick = () => {
     storyText.textContent =
       "You take the right path and see warm lights glowing ahead.";
   };
   ```

3. Connect the JavaScript file by adding this at the bottom of `index.html`, just before `</body>`:

   ```html
   <script src="script.js"></script>
   ```

Save everything and refresh.

✅ You should see:  
Clicking each button changes the story text.

🎉 You just made an interactive game.

## 🧠 What You Learned in Session 1

- HTML creates the page and story text
- CSS makes the page readable and friendly
- JavaScript reacts to button clicks
- IDs let JavaScript find things on the page
- Code can control a story

---

## 🔁 Try This (Optional Challenges)

**What this does for you:**  
Practicing small changes helps you get comfortable and builds confidence fast.

- Change the story text
- Rename the buttons
- Add a third button
- Make both buttons change the text in different ways

---

## 🆘 If Something Doesn’t Work

**What this does for you:**  
Debugging is how real programmers learn. These checks solve most issues quickly.

Check:

- File names (`script.js` vs `Script.js`)
- IDs match exactly
- Files are saved
- Browser is refreshed

Ask for help — that’s part of learning.

Always follow your family’s rules when using the internet.

You’ve officially completed Session 1 🚀
