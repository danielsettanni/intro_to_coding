# Intro to Coding

## Choose Your Own Adventure

This repository contains a beginner-friendly **Choose Your Own Adventure** game built with **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.

The project is part of *Intro to Coding*, a class where students learn the basics of coding by creating an interactive story they can play and share. No prior programming experience is required.

---

## 🎮 What This Project Is

Students build a web-based interactive story where:

- The player reads story text
- The player makes choices by clicking buttons
- The story changes based on those choices
- The game can remember items and past decisions

The project is taught over **5 sessions**, with a working, playable version at the end of **every session**.

---

## 🧠 What Students Learn

Through this project, students learn:

- Basic **HTML** for structure
- Basic **CSS** for styling and layout
- Basic **JavaScript** for interactivity
- How to separate story content from code
- How games track state (like inventory and choices)
- How to debug and test their own work

## 📚 Course Structure (5 Sessions)

Each session builds on the previous one.  
An example version of the project for **each session** can be found in folders named:

- `session-1/`
- `session-2/`
- `session-3/`
- `session-4/`
- `session-5/`

Each folder contains a complete, working version of the game as it exists at the end of that session.

### Session Overview

- **Session 1:** Basic interactive story (text + buttons)
- **Session 2:** Story engine with branching pages
- **Session 3:** Game state, inventory, and conditional choices
- **Session 4:** Images, styling, and atmosphere
- **Session 5:** Endings, polish, and publishing

Students can explore earlier sessions to review concepts or compare progress over time.

---

## 📁 Project Structure (Inside Each Session Folder)

Each session folder typically includes:

- `index.html`    # Main webpage
- `style.css`     # Styling and layout
- `story.js`      # Story content (pages and choices)
- `script.js`     # Game logic and engine
- `assets/`       # Images and sounds (optional)

---

## ▶️ How to Run the Game

### Option 1: Using Live Server (Recommended)

1. Open a session folder in **VS Code**
2. Right-click `index.html`
3. Select **“Open with Live Server”**

### Option 2: Open in a Browser

- Double-click `index.html` to open it in any modern web browser

---

## ✍️ Customizing the Story

Most story changes happen in **`story.js`**.

To add a new story page:

- Give it a unique name
- Write the story text
- Add choices that point to other pages

Example:

```js
forest: {
  text: "The forest is quiet and foggy.",
  choices: [
    { text: "Walk forward", target: "path" },
    { text: "Turn back", target: "start" }
  ]
}
```

## 🚀 Sharing Your Game

This project can be published for free using GitHub Pages, allowing students to share their game with friends and family.

### 🌍 Publish with GitHub Pages (Free)

> Do this with a parent/guardian or teacher.

1. Create a GitHub account (or use an approved account).
2. Create a new repository and upload your project files.
3. Make sure your game files are in the repository (at minimum: `index.html`, `style.css`, `script.js`, `story.js`).
4. In GitHub, open your repository:
   - Go to **Settings** → **Pages**
   - Under **Build and deployment**, set:
     - **Source:** Deploy from a branch
     - **Branch:** `main` (or `master`)
     - **Folder:** `/ (root)`
5. Click **Save**.
6. Wait 1–3 minutes, then refresh the Pages settings.
7. Open the published URL GitHub provides.

✅ Tip: If you are publishing a specific session, upload only that session’s files at repo root, or use a dedicated repository for that session.

### 🛠 If it doesn’t work

- Confirm `index.html` is named exactly `index.html`
- Confirm file names and capitalization match exactly
- Wait a minute and refresh (first deploy can take a moment)
- Check repository is public (or GitHub plan supports private Pages)
